I really enjoyed copilot as it's an 'integrated' chatGPT that knows what's going on with the other files too, so it avoids the back and forth from chatGPT. I like that it even created another file for the tests.

I'm quite impressed how similar Python is to JavaScript, so even someone with JavaScript knowledge that has never seen Python before, the Python code would still make sense (at least for those simple katas). I appreciate it can be more complex when it involves libraries etc.

I found interesting that identation is mandatory in Python - it will through an error if identation is not correct. It can be a bit annoying sometimes but it kind of make sense to 'force' a good identation.
